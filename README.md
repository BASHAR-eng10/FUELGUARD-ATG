## ÔøΩüîß Authentication Architecture

### NextAuth.js Integration with SQLite Backend
The application uses NextAuth.js v5.0 with a robust SQLite database backend:

- **Email-only Authentication**: No passwords required, secure email-based sign-in
- **JWT Sessions**: Stateless authentication with 24-hour session expiry
- **Role-based Authorization**: User roles and permissions stored in JWT tokens
- **Station Assignment**: Station managers are automatically assigned to their stations
- **Persistent Storage**: SQLite database for reliable token and user management
- **Type-Safe Operations**: Kysely ORM ensures database type safety

### Database Schema
```sql
-- Users table with role-based access
CREATE TABLE users (
  id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  email TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  name TEXT NOT NULL,
  role TEXT NOT NULL, -- 'general_manager' | 'station_manager'
  station_id TEXT,    -- For station managers
  email_verified INTEGER DEFAULT 0, -- SQLite boolean as integer
  created_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  updated_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

-- Email verification tokens with expiration
CREATE TABLE email_verification_tokens (
  id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  email TEXT NOT NULL,
  token TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  expires_at DATETIME NOT NULL, -- 24-hour expiry
  created_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

-- Stations for manager assignment
CREATE TABLE stations (
  id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  name TEXT NOT NULL,
  location TEXT NOT NULL,
  manager_id TEXT,
  is_active INTEGER DEFAULT 1, -- SQLite boolean as integer
  created_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  updated_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

### Authentication Flow
1. **Sign-in Request**: User enters their email address
2. **Authorization Check**: System verifies if email is in authorized users database
3. **Token Generation**: UUID verification token generated and stored with 24-hour expiry
4. **Email Verification**: Link sent via email (or logged in development)
5. **Token Verification**: User clicks link to verify email and create session
6. **Role Assignment**: User redirected to appropriate dashboard based on database role
7. **Automatic Cleanup**: Expired tokens are automatically removed

### Hybrid Client/Server Architecture
The authentication system intelligently handles both client and server contexts:

```typescript
// Server-side direct database access
export const getUserByEmailDirect = async (email: string): Promise<AuthUser | null>

// Client-side API calls
export const getUserByEmail = async (email: string): Promise<AuthUser | null>

// Smart context detection
const isServer = typeof window === 'undefined'
```
